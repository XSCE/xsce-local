How to Use the XO15 SD Card Image
=================================

Use the xo1.5 as a Server or as Client
--------------------------------------

SERVER:
    In this use case, the computer memory is needed for serving clients. The graphical User Interface will use memory that is really needed to keep track of what is happening in each of the clients. If there are only a handfull of clients, this may not be too much of a concern. But if there are many clients, it is best to turn off the GUI (see next section).

CLIENT:
    Used as a stand alone learning device, or with only a few clients, it will be more convenient to enable the GUI, and perhaps even ask the XO1.5 to boot directly into the Internet-in-a-Box browser.

How to change the Boot Configuration
------------------------------------

The default boot configuation can be changed to the desired state: 

    xs-text -- preserves as much memory as possible for serving clients
    xs-iiab -- goes directly to the Internet-in-a-Box, best for research or learning
    xs-desktop -- maximum flexibility to use all the available services of the XO15.


As a final set of optionos, the desktop that is selected can be either the sugar activity wheel, or the gnome desktop:

* Move from sugar to gnome by hovering over the center XO, selecting "My Settings", then "switch desktop" with the big foot, and click reboot.
* From gnome, transfer back to sugar by clicking the icon on the left of the desktop "Switch to Sugar"
